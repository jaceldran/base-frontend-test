# My solution with _Vanilla JS_

## Running the solution

## Preventing code breaks

## Description

## Frameworks, libraries and tools

**Vanilla JS**

**CSS (SASS)**

**HighCharts**

**XAMPP**

**Insonmia** is a REST client for tests. After reading the specifications carefully, the first thing I did for this project was to create a new workspace called "linkener" and check the responses to the API server invocations.

The next step was to start the development of a SPA page interpreting the needs of the interface.
